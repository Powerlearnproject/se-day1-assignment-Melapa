T
he rise of artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) relies heavily on software engineering to develop robust and innovative solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968 NATO Conference – Birth of Software Engineering

Addressed the "Software Crisis", emphasizing structured methodologies.
Led to the Waterfall Model and formalized software engineering as a discipline.
1980s – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Introduced encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, improving code modularity.
Popularized languages like C++, Java, and Python, enhancing software maintainability.
2000s – Agile & DevOps Revolution

Agile (2001) enabled iterative, customer-focused development.
DevOps integrated development & operations, speeding up CI/CD and cloud-based deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis

Planning

Create a roadmap, estimate resources, cost, and timelines.
Define project scope and risk management strategies.
Design

Develop system architecture, database structures, and UI/UX layouts.
Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks.
Implementation (Coding)

Convert design into source code using programming languages.
Follow coding standards, best practices, and version control.
Testing

Detect and fix bugs through unit, integration, and system testing.
Ensure the software meets quality and functional requirements.
Deployment

Release the software to users in a production environment.
Perform final optimizations and monitor performance.
Maintenance & Support

Address software updates, bug fixes, and security patches.
Improve features based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
Each phase ensures a structured and efficient approach to software development.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two distinct software development methodologies, each suited for different types of projects. Waterfall follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase—such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment—must be completed before moving to the next. This method is best for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, such as developing software for regulated industries like medical devices, where compliance and documentation are crucial. However, its rigid structure makes it difficult to accommodate changes once development begins.

In contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible methodology that emphasizes continuous collaboration, feedback, and incremental deliveries. Agile teams work in short cycles, often called sprints, allowing for frequent reassessments and modifications based on evolving requirements. This makes Agile ideal for dynamic projects, such as mobile app development, where user feedback and changing market trends influence the product’s direction. Unlike Waterfall, Agile integrates testing throughout the development process, ensuring continuous improvement and reducing the risk of major issues at the final stages.

While Waterfall provides structure and predictability, Agile offers adaptability and responsiveness, making it the preferred choice for projects that require rapid iterations and customer involvement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
